# Effects-of-Social-Media-on-Mental-Health--ML-Research-Project
Machine learning-based research project analyzing the effects of social media on mental health using classification (SVM, KNN, ID3, Naive Bayes) and clustering (K-Means, K-Medoids) models.

# Effects of Social Media on Mental Health - ML Research Project
This research project examines the impact of social media usage on mental health, utilizing machine learning algorithms for both classification and clustering. The analysis compares multiple models to identify the most effective approach for predicting mental health status based on social media patterns.

## 🧪 Project Overview
- **Goal:** Predict and understand mental health trends based on social media behavior using ML.
- **Techniques Used:** Classification (SVM, KNN, ID3, Naive Bayes) and Clustering (K-Means, K-Medoids)
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score (for classification); Silhouette Score, Davies-Bouldin Index, Calinski-Harabasz Index (for clustering)
